### Use Case for Histogram with and without NumPy Using Matplotlib

Histograms are essential for visualizing the distribution of numerical data. Below, we explore how to create a histogram using both NumPy and pure Python lists, along with the challenges of not using NumPy.

#### Scenario: Analyzing Exam Scores

Let's consider a scenario where a teacher wants to analyze the distribution of exam scores for a class of students. The teacher can create a histogram to visualize how students performed on the exam.

### 1. Creating a Histogram with NumPy

Using NumPy simplifies data handling and statistical calculations.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

Step 1: Import Libraries

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

Step 2: Generate Sample Data with NumPy

# Generate random exam scores for 100 students
np.random.seed(0)  # For reproducibility
exam_scores = np.random.randint(0, 101, size=100)  # Scores between 0 and 100

Step 3: Create Histogram Using NumPy

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Create a histogram
plt.hist(exam_scores, bins=10, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')

# Adding labels and title
plt.title('Exam Score Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Scores')
plt.ylabel('Number of Students')
plt.xticks(range(0, 101, 10))  # Set x-ticks to show every 10 points
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

### 2. Creating a Histogram Without NumPy

You can create a histogram using pure Python lists, but it requires more manual handling of the data.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

Step 1: Import Matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random

Step 2: Generate Sample Data Without NumPy

# Generate random exam scores for 100 students
random.seed(0)  # For reproducibility
exam_scores = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(100)]  # Scores between 0 and 100

Step 3: Create Histogram Using Pure Python Lists

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Create histogram manually
bins = [i for i in range(0, 110, 10)]
plt.hist(exam_scores, bins=bins, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')

# Adding labels and title
plt.title('Exam Score Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Scores')
plt.ylabel('Number of Students')
plt.xticks(range(0, 101, 10))  # Set x-ticks to show every 10 points
plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

### Challenges of Not Using NumPy

1. Performance: When dealing with larger datasets, using lists can lead to slower performance compared to NumPy arrays, which are optimized for numerical operations.

2. Functionality: NumPy provides built-in functions to easily generate random numbers, calculate statistics, and perform numerical operations, which simplifies the code and reduces the likelihood of errors.

3. Ease of Use: NumPy handles data types and shapes more efficiently. Without it, you may need to manually check and handle data types, which can complicate your code.

4. Memory Management: NumPy arrays use less memory and provide better performance for large datasets due to their efficient storage and operations compared to Python lists.

### Conclusion

While it is possible to create histograms using pure Python lists, using NumPy greatly simplifies the process, enhances performance, and provides additional functionality. For small datasets, using lists may be manageable, but for larger datasets or more complex analyses, leveraging NumPy is highly recommended for efficiency and ease of use.
