### Use Case for Waffle Chart Using PyWaffle: Employee Engagement Survey Results

A company conducts an employee engagement survey to assess how engaged employees feel within the organization. The survey uses a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is "Very Disengaged" and 5 is "Very Engaged."

Objective:
To visualize the distribution of employee engagement levels using a waffle chart, making it easy for HR and management to understand the results.

### Data Collected:
- Total Respondents: 500
- Engagement Ratings:
  - Very Disengaged (1): 30 respondents (6%)
  - Disengaged (2): 70 respondents (14%)
  - Neutral (3): 150 respondents (30%)
  - Engaged (4): 180 respondents (36%)
  - Very Engaged (5): 70 respondents (14%)

### Implementation Using PyWaffle

#### Step 1: Install PyWaffle
If you haven't already installed PyWaffle, you can do so using pip:

pip install pywaffle

#### Step 2: Create the Waffle Chart
Hereâ€™s how to create a waffle chart in Python using PyWaffle:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pywaffle import Waffle

# Data for the waffle chart
data = {
    'Very Disengaged (1)': 30,
    'Disengaged (2)': 70,
    'Neutral (3)': 150,
    'Engaged (4)': 180,
    'Very Engaged (5)': 70,
}

# Create a Waffle chart
fig = plt.figure(
    FigureClass=Waffle,
    plots=1,
    figsize=(10, 5),
    rows=10,  # Total rows in the waffle chart (10 rows = 100 squares)
    values=data,
    title={'label': 'Employee Engagement Levels', 'loc': 'center'},
    labels=[f'{k} ({v})' for k, v in data.items()],
    colors=["#FF9999", "#FFCC99", "#FFFF99", "#99FF99", "#99CCFF"],
    legend={'loc': 'upper left', 'bbox_to_anchor': (1, 1)}
)

# Display the chart
plt.show()

### Explanation of the Code:
1. Data Preparation: The data dictionary contains the engagement ratings and their respective counts.
2. Waffle Chart Creation:
   - The `Waffle` class from PyWaffle is used to create the chart.
   - The `rows` parameter defines how many rows will be in the waffle (10 rows for 100 squares).
   - The `values` parameter takes the engagement data.
   - The `title` and `labels` parameters provide the chart title and labels for each segment.
   - The `colors` parameter assigns specific colors to each engagement level.
3. Display: Finally, `plt.show()` renders the chart.

### Insights:
- Proportional Representation: The waffle chart visually represents employee engagement levels, making it easy to see that the majority of employees (36% engaged and 14% very engaged) are satisfied, while a smaller portion feel disengaged.
- Areas for Improvement: The 20% of respondents who are very disengaged or disengaged can be targeted for improvement initiatives.

### Conclusion:
Using PyWaffle to create a waffle chart provides a clear and effective visualization of employee engagement survey results. This visualization can be used in presentations to facilitate discussions about employee satisfaction and potential areas for improvement within the organization.
